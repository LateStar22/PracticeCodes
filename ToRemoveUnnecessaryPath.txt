You have to customize the prompt function in your PowerShell profile (%userprofile%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1); it may be blank or even not exist if you have never modified it before.

Open your profile (e.g., open the aforementioned file or while in PowerShell, Notepad $profile)

Add the following to your profile:

function prompt {
  $p = Split-Path -leaf -path (Get-Location)
  "$p> "
}
Save the profile

Restart PowerShell

Optional. If you get a message that says you are not allowed to run scripts, then you need to copy/paste this line in PowerShell:

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser   --- important
and restart.
